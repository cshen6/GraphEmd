# Graph Encoder Embedding

Implement the Graph Encoder Embedding from:

**C. Shen and Q. Wang and C. E. Priebe, "One-Hot Graph Encoder Embedding", IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, accepted, 2023. arXiv:2109.13098**


The core function is in the **Main** folder, named as GraphEncoder and implemented in Matlab / R / Python. 

The Data folder contains the real data we used for the paper, and the Experiments folder contains various experiments and plots functions in different softwares.
